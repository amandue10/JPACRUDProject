# JPACRUDProject
This project utilizes a MySQL database to manipulate data. For this project, we were required to create a single table using MySQL workbench and an entity java class.  

Below are a list of objectives that we saw the JPACrud application reinforcing.

Creating a SQL database and subsequent tables.
Configuring a JPA project.
Mapping Entities to SQL tables.
Creating JUnit tests to ensure our JPA mappings are correct.
Integrating a Spring MVC project with a JPA project.
Performing basic CRUD operations.
Deploying an application to AWS

This project is has been deployed to AWS but will need to be worked on further before users are able to utilize the program.
